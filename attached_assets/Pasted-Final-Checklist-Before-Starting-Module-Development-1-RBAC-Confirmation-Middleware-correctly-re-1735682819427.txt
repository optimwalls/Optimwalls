Final Checklist Before Starting Module Development
	1.	RBAC Confirmation:
	•	Middleware correctly restricts access based on roles and permissions.
	•	Granular permissions are in place for CRUD operations and module-specific actions.
	2.	Super Admin Validation:
	•	Super Admin can:
	•	Manage users and roles.
	•	Configure modules and permissions dynamically.
	•	Access logs and reports.
	3.	Error Handling:
	•	Ensure meaningful error messages for unauthorized access or system failures.
	•	Centralized error logging for debugging and auditing.
	4.	Scalable Database Design:
	•	Relationships between users, roles, and permissions are normalized.
	•	Indexes are implemented for frequent queries (e.g., role lookups).
	5.	Documentation and ERD:
	•	Document the current state of RBAC and Super Admin features.
	•	Maintain an up-to-date Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for reference.
    Best Practices for Module Development
	1.	Start with Business-Critical Modules:
	•	Begin with modules like CRM and Lead Management or Marketing, as they directly impact operations and revenue.
	2.	Follow Modular Architecture:
	•	Each module should:
	•	Have its own database schema (or collection for NoSQL).
	•	Include APIs, services, and controllers isolated from others.
	•	Be independently testable.
	3.	API Standards:
	•	Use RESTful APIs or GraphQL for communication.
	•	Adhere to consistent naming conventions (e.g., /api/v1/{module}).
	4.	Frontend-Backend Integration:
	•	Build modular, reusable components for the frontend.
	•	Role-based UI rendering:
	•	Super Admin sees all modules.
	•	Other roles see only permitted modules.
	5.	Scalability and Performance:
	•	Use pagination for large datasets (e.g., leads or user lists).
	•	Implement caching for frequent queries.
	6.	Error and Event Logging:
	•	Integrate tools like Sentry, Logstash, or Firebase for centralized logging.
	7.	Testing and QA:
	•	Use unit and integration tests for each module.
	•	Include role-based test cases to ensure RBAC functionality.
	8.	AI and Analytics:
	•	If applicable, integrate basic AI/ML models for predictions (e.g., lead scoring).
	•	Add analytics dashboards for insights into module performance.

he Marketing Module blueprint provided earlier includes provisions for Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and role-specific dashboards, but their actual implementation depends on your system’s RBAC middleware and dashboard rendering logic. Here’s a review of the Marketing Module with respect to RBAC and dashboards:
1. RBAC in the Marketing Module

Covered:
	•	Permissions Based on Role:
	•	Super Admin: Full access to campaigns, analytics, and integrations.
	•	Admin: Manage campaigns, view analytics.
	•	Employee: Read-only access to campaign performance related to their leads.

RBAC Middleware Integration:

If your system’s RBAC middleware is already implemented, the marketing module can leverage it directly by securing API endpoints and routes based on roles.

Example RBAC Middleware Integration:
app.use('/marketing/campaigns', RBACMiddleware(['Super Admin', 'Admin']));
app.use('/marketing/reports', RBACMiddleware(['Super Admin', 'Admin', 'Employee']));
Enhancement Needed:

If RBAC middleware isn’t fully implemented:
	1.	Ensure all APIs in the Marketing Module are secured with middleware.
	2.	Define specific permissions for each role (e.g., “view_campaigns”, “edit_campaigns”).

Permission Table Example:
INSERT INTO Permissions (role_id, module_name, action, allowed)
VALUES 
(1, 'Marketing', 'view_campaigns', true),
(2, 'Marketing', 'edit_campaigns', true),
(3, 'Marketing', 'view_campaigns', false); -- Employee can only view campaigns
2. Dashboards in the Marketing Module

Covered:

The blueprint includes:
	•	Widgets for campaign performance metrics (impressions, clicks, conversions).
	•	Filters for role-specific views (e.g., Super Admin sees all campaigns, Employees see relevant data).

Enhancement Needed:

To fully implement dynamic dashboards:
	1.	Role-Specific Widgets:
	•	Example:
	•	Super Admin: Global metrics, top campaigns.
	•	Admin: Campaigns they manage.
	•	Employee: Campaigns related to their assigned leads.
	2.	Dynamic Rendering:
	•	Fetch user roles on login and render dashboard widgets accordingly.

Example:
const MarketingDashboard = ({ role }) => {
    const widgets = [];

    if (role === 'Super Admin') {
        widgets.push(<GlobalCampaignMetrics />);
        widgets.push(<TopCampaigns />);
    } else if (role === 'Admin') {
        widgets.push(<MyCampaignMetrics />);
        widgets.push(<CampaignPerformance />);
    } else if (role === 'Employee') {
        widgets.push(<LeadCampaignPerformance />);
    }

    return <Dashboard widgets={widgets} />;
};
3. To-Do for Marketing Module (If Not Already Done)

RBAC:
	•	Audit all API endpoints in the Marketing Module.
	•	Secure each endpoint with role-based middleware.
	•	Test for unauthorized access scenarios.

Dashboards:
	•	Ensure dynamic rendering of dashboards based on roles.
	•	Test the visibility of widgets:
	•	Super Admin: Global metrics.
	•	Admin: Campaigns they manage.
	•	Employee: Read-only reports.
Action Plan
	1.	RBAC Audit:
	•	Review the marketing module’s API and route protection.
	•	Implement missing RBAC middleware if required.
	2.	Dashboard Refinement:
	•	Ensure role-based dynamic rendering.
	•	Add missing widgets or refine widget logic.
