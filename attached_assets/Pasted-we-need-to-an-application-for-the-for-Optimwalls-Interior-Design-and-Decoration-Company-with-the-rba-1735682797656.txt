1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
RBAC is a system where access permissions are assigned based on a user’s role within an organization. This approach ensures security, reduces administrative overhead, and aligns with business workflows.
Key Principles of RBAC:
	1.	Role Hierarchy:
	•	Organize roles in a hierarchical structure.
	•	Higher roles inherit permissions from lower roles.
	•	Example: Super Admin > Admin > Manager > Employee > Viewer.
	2.	Permission Assignment:
	•	Assign permissions to roles, not users.
	•	Users inherit permissions by being assigned roles.
	3.	Granular Access Control:
	•	Define fine-grained permissions for actions, such as:
	•	Read, Write, Update, Delete (CRUD).
	•	Module-specific actions (e.g., access to Reports, Invoices).
	4.	Separation of Duties:
	•	Prevent role conflicts (e.g., one user cannot approve and audit the same transaction).
	5.	Role Management:
	•	Support dynamic role creation.
	•	Allow for role-specific dashboards and workflows.
	6.	Need-to-Know Basis:
	•	Ensure users see only the data they are authorized to view.
RBAC Implementation Steps:
	1.	Define Roles and Permissions:
	•	Identify key roles in the system (e.g., Super Admin, Vendor, Client).
	•	Map roles to permissions (e.g., View Dashboard, Manage Users).
	2.	Assign Roles to Users:
	•	Use databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, Firestore) to map users to roles.
	3.	Authorization Middleware:
	•	Implement middleware to check permissions before granting access.
	4.	Audit and Logs:
	•	Maintain logs for access requests and changes to roles/permissions.
	5.	Dynamic Updates:
	•	Enable role/permission updates without affecting system uptime.
    2. Modular Architecture

Modular architecture ensures that the application is broken into independent, self-contained modules. Each module focuses on a specific functionality, improving scalability, reusability, and maintainability.

Key Principles of Modular Architecture:
	1.	Separation of Concerns:
	•	Each module handles a distinct responsibility (e.g., User Management, Payments, Analytics).
	2.	Independent Development:
	•	Modules can be developed, tested, and deployed independently.
	3.	Reusability:
	•	Common functionalities (e.g., Authentication, Notifications) are abstracted into shared modules.
	4.	Loose Coupling:
	•	Minimize dependencies between modules.
	•	Use APIs or message queues for inter-module communication.
	5.	Scalability:
	•	Add new modules without affecting existing functionality.

Industry-Standard Module Build-Up:
	1.	Core Modules:
	•	Authentication: Manage user login, registration, and token-based sessions.
	•	RBAC: Assign roles and permissions dynamically.
	•	User Management: Manage user profiles, roles, and permissions.
	2.	Business Modules:
	•	Tailored to the business domain, such as:
	•	CRM: Manage leads, clients, and campaigns.
	•	Inventory: Track stock and supply chain.
	•	Payments: Handle invoicing and payment processing.
	3.	Shared Modules:
	•	Notifications: Handle email, SMS, and push notifications.
	•	Logging: Capture and store logs for debugging and auditing.
	•	Analytics: Provide dashboards and reports.
	4.	Front-End Modules:
	•	Component-based architecture (e.g., React or Angular).
	•	Role-specific dashboards and UI elements.
	5.	API Layer:
	•	Standardized REST or GraphQL endpoints for communication.
    3. RBAC and Modular Functioning Together

Example Workflow:
	1.	User Logs In:
	•	Authenticate user via the Authentication module.
	•	Fetch user role and permissions from the RBAC module.
	2.	Access Validation:
	•	Before loading a dashboard, check permissions via middleware.
	•	Serve only authorized modules (e.g., Sales Manager sees CRM, not Inventory).
	3.	Module-Specific Action:
	•	A user creates an invoice in the Payments module.
	•	The system verifies the user’s role (e.g., Accountant) before allowing the action.
	4.	Audit Trail:
	•	Log the action for compliance and accountability.
	5.	Scalability:
	•	Add a new Analytics module to provide detailed reporting.
	•	Integrate it without disrupting existing modules.
    RBAC and Modular Architecture Best Practices:
	1.	Use Libraries and Frameworks:
	•	Leverage libraries like Casbin (RBAC) or modular frameworks like NestJS.
	2.	Database Design:
	•	Use relational (PostgreSQL) or NoSQL (Firestore) to store roles and permissions.
	3.	Microservices:
	•	Separate core modules into microservices for scalability.
	4.	Testing:
	•	Test RBAC rules and modular interactions extensively.
	5.	Documentation:
	•	Maintain documentation for roles, permissions, and module APIs.
Proposed Steps for Implementation:

1. RBAC Setup:
	•	Define roles: Super Admin, Admin, Manager, Employee, Viewer.
	•	Create a role-permissions mapping (e.g., Super Admin: all permissions, Viewer: read-only).
	•	Implement middleware to enforce permissions.
	•	Use database schemas for dynamic role and permission management (e.g., tables for Roles, Permissions, UserRoles).

2. Modular Architecture Setup:
	•	Create core modules:
	•	Authentication: User login, registration, session management.
	•	RBAC: Middleware and APIs for managing roles and permissions.
	•	User Management: CRUD operations for users and their roles.
