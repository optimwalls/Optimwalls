Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Integration

Core Principles for RBAC in the CRM
	1.	Role Hierarchy:
	•	Roles: Super Admin, Admin, Manager, Employee.
	•	Permissions:
	•	Super Admin: Full access (create, edit, delete, view).
	•	Admin: Manage leads, pipelines, and team performance.
	•	Manager: View team performance, update lead statuses.
	•	Employee: Access assigned leads only.
	2.	Granular Permission Control:
	•	Each action (e.g., viewing leads, updating pipelines) is permission-guarded.
	3.	Database Schema for RBAC:
CREATE TABLE Roles (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE
);

CREATE TABLE Permissions (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    role_id INT REFERENCES Roles(id),
    module_name VARCHAR(50), -- e.g., "CRM", "Marketing"
    action VARCHAR(50), -- e.g., "view", "edit", "delete"
    allowed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);

CREATE TABLE UserRoles (
    user_id INT REFERENCES Users(id),
    role_id INT REFERENCES Roles(id)
);
	4.	Middleware for RBAC Enforcement:
	•	Example Middleware for Role and Permission Checks:
function RBACMiddleware(requiredRole, action) {
    return async (req, res, next) => {
        const { userId } = req;
        const userRole = await getUserRole(userId);

        const isAllowed = await checkPermission(userRole, 'CRM', action);
        if (!isAllowed) {
            return res.status(403).json({ message: "Forbidden" });
        }
        next();
    };
}
Role-Specific Dashboards

Dynamic Dashboards Based on RBAC
	1.	Super Admin Dashboard:
	•	Modules Access:
	•	Full system view across Marketing, CRM, and Design.
	•	Widgets:
	•	System usage statistics, team performance analytics, lead conversion rates.
	•	Permissions:
	•	Manage all modules, users, and permissions.
	2.	Admin Dashboard:
	•	Modules Access:
	•	Full CRM access, limited Marketing and Design access.
	•	Widgets:
	•	Lead pipeline performance, campaign ROI, top-performing employees.
	•	Permissions:
	•	Manage leads, view reports, and assign leads.
	3.	Manager Dashboard:
	•	Modules Access:
	•	CRM only.
	•	Widgets:
	•	Team performance (e.g., lead response times), overdue follow-ups.
	•	Permissions:
	•	View and update assigned leads, monitor team activities.
	4.	Employee Dashboard:
	•	Modules Access:
	•	Assigned leads only in CRM.
	•	Widgets:
	•	Personal lead list, daily tasks, follow-up reminders.
	•	Permissions:
	•	Update assigned leads, log activities.

Dynamic UI Rendering
	•	Frontend Implementation:
	•	Fetch user role and permissions during login.
	•	Render dashboard components dynamically based on allowed modules and actions.
	•	Example:
const Dashboard = ({ role }) => {
    switch (role) {
        case 'Super Admin':
            return <SuperAdminDashboard />;
        case 'Admin':
            return <AdminDashboard />;
        case 'Manager':
            return <ManagerDashboard />;
        case 'Employee':
            return <EmployeeDashboard />;
        default:
            return <Unauthorized />;
    }
};
How RBAC is Applied in All Modules
	1.	Marketing Module:
	•	Super Admin: Full control over campaigns, analytics, and integrations.
	•	Admin: Manage campaigns, view analytics.
	•	Employee: Access read-only reports on leads they’ve been assigned.
	2.	CRM Module:
	•	Super Admin: Create and assign roles, full lead management.
	•	Admin: Assign leads, manage pipeline stages.
	•	Manager: Monitor team performance and update pipelines.
	•	Employee: Access and update only assigned leads.
	3.	Design Module:
	•	Super Admin: Assign projects to designers, view all projects.
	•	Designer: Access assigned projects and upload designs.
	•	Client (via Client Portal): View their project status and provide feedback.
	4.	Analytics and Reporting:
	•	Reports and analytics are filtered by role:
	•	Super Admin: Full system-wide data.
	•	Admin: Team-specific data.
	•	Manager: Leads and performance data for their team.
	•	Employee: Personal metrics only.
Automation in RBAC and Dashboards
	1.	Automatic Role Assignment:
	•	Assign roles automatically based on user onboarding workflows.
	•	Example:
	•	A new hire is automatically assigned the “Employee” role with limited access.
	2.	Real-Time Role Changes:
	•	If a user’s role changes (e.g., Employee → Manager), update their dashboard and permissions instantly.
	3.	Audit Logs:
	•	Track all permission changes, role assignments, and access attempts for security and accountability.
Example Log Schema:
CREATE TABLE AuditLogs (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT REFERENCES Users(id),
    action VARCHAR(50), -- e.g., "assigned_role", "updated_permission"
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
	4.	Dynamic Dashboard Widgets:
	•	Widgets refresh in real-time based on role and permissions (e.g., an Employee sees only their assigned leads).
Final Validation Checklist
	1.	RBAC Validation:
	•	Can roles and permissions be assigned dynamically?
	•	Are all module actions secured with middleware?
	2.	Dashboard Validation:
	•	Does each role have access only to their allowed data and widgets?
	•	Are dashboards visually appealing, fast, and responsive?
	3.	Testing:
	•	Unit tests for role-based middleware.
	•	Integration tests for dashboards (e.g., verifying data visibility).
